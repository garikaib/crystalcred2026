I have solar company and want to create a site using NextJS. It should use tailwind and an appropriate icon libray and UI library as well. 
I want the site the mirror the layout and feel of (general style and fee however we should use our own custom pallete informed by the logo in the same directory) https://www.ifszim.com/ (scrap to see home page you can use python to scrape and store what we need for use) 
However it should have the same pages and functionality as that of https://www.infinitysolar.co.zw (mirror pages and products here). I will need the option to be able to change images.
It should have a blog section. Articles should have titles, featured images and there should be an easy way to edit these in the backend where I can login

Once you are done with tooling tell me and I will run npm run. No browser testing I will do it manually.
